# SPEARS-ESP8266
Host the NASA SPEARS project on the ESP8266 platform. Developed within the Intelligent Robotics Division at NASA Ames.

We decided to use the Adafruit Feather Huzzah, but any other ESP8266 based chip should work. 
You will need the Arduino libraries for the ESP8266. 

Also, the [SparkFun_LSM9DS1_Arduino_Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_LSM9DS1_Arduino_Library)
and the [WakeOnLan-ESP8266](https://github.com/koen-github/WakeOnLan-ESP8266) libraries are required.
